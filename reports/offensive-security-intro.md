# Offensive Security Introduction

**Platform:** TryHackMe – Pre-Security Path  
**Room:** Offensive Security Intro

## Objective
To understand what offensive security is and why ethical hackers simulate attacks to improve security.

## What I Learned
- Offensive security focuses on thinking like an attacker.
- Ethical hackers are legally allowed to test systems with permission.
- The goal is to find weaknesses before malicious attackers do.
- Offensive and defensive security have different roles but work together.

## Practical Exposure
This room included a guided example demonstrating how attackers may look for hidden resources on a website. The activity was intended to introduce the concept of discovering weaknesses, not to teach the tool in depth.

## Key Takeaway
Offensive security is about identifying and understanding weaknesses from an attacker’s perspective so organizations can fix them and reduce risk.
