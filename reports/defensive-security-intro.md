# Defensive Security Introduction

**Platform:** TryHackMe – Pre-Security Path  
**Room:** Defensive Security Intro  

## Objective
To learn the defender’s perspective: how organizations detect, contain, and recover from security incidents in a legal and controlled context.

## What I learned
- Defensive security focuses on detection, containment, and recovery rather than exploitation.  
- Monitoring and logging are core defender activities — logs provide the evidence defenders use to investigate incidents.  
- Basic defensive controls include patching, access control (least privilege), firewalls/network segmentation, and backups.  
- Incident response is a process: identify an event, contain impact, eradicate root cause, recover systems, and learn from the incident.  
- Communication and documentation (clear logs and reports) are essential for effective defense.

## Practical exposure (as presented in the room)
The room provided an overview of defender responsibilities and showed conceptual examples of how monitoring and response work in practice. It emphasized working within legal boundaries and the importance of timely remediation.

## Key takeaway
Understanding defensive perspectives makes offensive testing more responsible and useful — good defense and good offense together improve overall security.
